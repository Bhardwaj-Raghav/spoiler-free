#### About Us:
#### About Us:
The "Spoiler Free" extension is developed by Raghav Bhardwaj. It started as a personal project during the hype for God of War Ragnarok and updated to cover various games, movies, and TV shows that were famous at the time. I used this extension personally for two years, refining it based on my own needs and feedback. After two years of personal use, I decided to release it for public use.

My goal is to make browsing the web more enjoyable and stress-free for everyone.
